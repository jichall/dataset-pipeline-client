[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rafaelcn/dataset-pipeline-client.svg?token=agoYobPmasJqPwFp7s8p&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rafaelcn/dataset-pipeline-client)

This is the tool that has three functions:

- Read a directory within its files with the specified extension
- Send the content of those files (JSON) to the server
- Consult the server about the value of an object with the attribute _pk_ of _pk_

For more information read the documentation to see how everything was
implemented as well as some proposals of improvement.
